# Air Quality Monitoring Project

Team Members: Sofia Zanti, Vasilisa Matafonova, Tim Marchenko

## Introduction
Air quality has a significant impact on daily life, especially for individuals with chronic conditions where polluted or dry air can be harmful. Monitoring air quality is essential to understanding its effects and finding ways to improve it. 

This project aims to collect and analyze historical air quality data, identify effective improvement strategies, and predict future trends. Using data visualization, we will showcase changes in air quality over time and provide insights for future improvements.

## Goal
Our primary objective is to visualize the changes in air quality over the years and predict future trends. We will identify contributing factors, distinguish beneficial from harmful influences, and analyze historical data to develop future projections.

## Expected Outcome
By the end of this project, we aim to achieve the following:
- **Data Visualization**: Generate graphs and data frames illustrating historical air quality changes.
- **Analysis Report**: Document methodologies, results, and insights.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Forecast future air quality changes and evaluate the potential impact of positive interventions.
